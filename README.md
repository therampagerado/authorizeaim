# thirty bees Authorize.net module

The thirty bees Authorize.net module works with the payment provider Authorize.net allowing you to accept credit card payments safely and securely on your website. This module uses the AIM gateway option that blends in with your site and keeps users on your site during the whole payment process.

**This module does require a SSL certificate to be installed on the site for it to show up as a payment method**
